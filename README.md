# my project for the empower hacks hackathon
This backend code is the basics of the app that I am trying to create, as this involves the main element of it, helping students with the same book interests form a community, as this is one of the big problems first generation, low-income students face.
As this project continues to develop, the dataset with people could expand (right now it is a very miniscule one that I created), and could have more values, such as specific location.
